# torch-mnist
A simple example of using common packages with torch to train a (low performing) neural network on the MNIST dataset.

I would suggest using this as a low-level template getting familiar with training feed-forward neural networks with torch. It doesn't provide any typical niceties of production code like encapsulation, modularity, or code reuse.

This is not a state of the art neural network. **Model performance is low, around 0.75 accuracy. There are many better models that you can implement; this is intentionally simple.**
